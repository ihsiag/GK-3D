# GK3D : Version 0.3.0 : Work in progress

## Discription
GK3D is an open-ended project of developing new methods of designing in 3D-Space. It is mainly focused on the ways of taking uncontrollable elements into the designing process in 3D-Space in real-time.

This software is an alpha version, and is unsupported.
Use at your own risk.

## Abstruct
This software contains three phases for designing an object.

1. LABORATORY-PHASE
1. SELECTING-PHSASE
1. MODELING-PHASE

### LABORATORY-PHASE
In this phase, you can import your 3D-model(.ply). The number of model's vertices should be less than 2000.  
You can give damage to your model on order to get it buckled or deformed.
